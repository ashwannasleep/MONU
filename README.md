MONU – THIS IS YOUR MOMENT


MONU is a digital planner designed to help you organize your life in a clear, calm, and meaningful way. Inspired by the structure of Notion and the aesthetic of the Orlo planner, MONU brings together thoughtful planning tools with a clean design that keeps the focus on what matters most—your time, your goals, your habits.

What MONU lets you do
Start with a personalized welcome — enter your name, get a motivational quote, and choose what kind of planning you'd like to begin with.

Plan your year with a simple, structured 12-month overview. Each month includes space for tasks, and you can easily toggle between what’s left to do and what you’ve finished.

Use the monthly planner to keep track of events, goals, and notes. It connects with Google Calendar so everything stays in sync.

Break things down day by day with the daily plan page. Add tasks, set times, estimate how long things will take, and drag things around as plans change.

Create a bucket list that’s more than just a checklist — add categories, dates, and links to keep everything organized and inspiring.

Build habits with a visual tracker and customizable routine editor. Set your own icons, pick which days you want to do things, and check in with how it’s going.

Use the Pomodoro timer to stay focused. Choose your mode (study, reading, work), customize the session time, and even add background rain sound for a calming effect.

Reflect on the bigger picture with the Future Vision page. Set goals for different areas of your life and check in on where you’re heading.
